# Lab Order Assignment & Authorization Implementation

## Features Implemented:

### 1. ✅ Track Lab Scientist Who Handled Results (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Database already has `uploadedBy` field in `LabResult` table
- ✅ Added uploader display in lab results list page with User icon
- ✅ Added "Handled by [Name] (Lab Scientist)" in details modal
- ✅ Added handler info to PDF view for downloads
- ✅ Updated both lab tech and patient API endpoints to include uploader data

### 2. ✅ Read-Only Access for Other Lab Scientists (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Added authorization checks in finalize endpoint - only uploader or admin can finalize
- ✅ Created comprehensive update/delete endpoints with ownership validation
- ✅ Prevents editing finalized or released results
- ✅ UI displays "Edit" and "Finalize" buttons only for the uploader
- ✅ Edit button allows correcting mistakes before finalization
- ✅ Shows read-only message for other lab scientists: "This result was handled by [Name]. Only they can finalize it."
- ✅ Error messages display authorization failures clearly

### 3. Assign Lab Orders to Specific Lab Scientists
- ✅ Added `assignedTo` field to `LabOrder` table
- ✅ Migration applied successfully
- Need to:
  - Update lab order creation API to accept `assignedTo`
  - Update lab order listing API to filter by assigned scientist
  - Update UI to show assignment and allow selection

## Database Changes:

```prisma
model LabOrder {
  assignedTo  Int?           @map("assigned_to")
  
  // Relation
  assignedLabTech User?      @relation("AssignedLabTech", fields: [assignedTo], references: [id])
}

model User {
  labOrdersAssigned       LabOrder[]            @relation("AssignedLabTech")
}
```

## Next Steps:

1. Update API endpoints
2. Add authorization middleware
3. Update UI components
4. Test all features
