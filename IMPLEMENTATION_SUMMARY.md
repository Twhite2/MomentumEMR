# Lab Order Assignment & Authorization Implementation

## Features Implemented:

### 1. Track Lab Scientist Who Handled Results
- ✅ Database already has `uploadedBy` field in `LabResult` table
- ✅ Display lab scientist name in results view
- Need to update UI to show uploader name

### 2. Read-Only Access for Other Lab Scientists
- Need to add authorization checks in lab result edit endpoints
- Only the lab scientist who uploaded can edit
- Others can view but cannot modify

### 3. Assign Lab Orders to Specific Lab Scientists
- ✅ Added `assignedTo` field to `LabOrder` table
- ✅ Migration applied successfully
- Need to:
  - Update lab order creation API to accept `assignedTo`
  - Update lab order listing API to filter by assigned scientist
  - Update UI to show assignment and allow selection

## Database Changes:

```prisma
model LabOrder {
  assignedTo  Int?           @map("assigned_to")
  
  // Relation
  assignedLabTech User?      @relation("AssignedLabTech", fields: [assignedTo], references: [id])
}

model User {
  labOrdersAssigned       LabOrder[]            @relation("AssignedLabTech")
}
```

## Next Steps:

1. Update API endpoints
2. Add authorization middleware
3. Update UI components
4. Test all features
