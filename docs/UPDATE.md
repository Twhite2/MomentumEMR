Nurses interface:
1. Sorting of the patient queue is not functioning properly in terms of check in and check
out. Checked out goes to last in the queue on the said day.(should be based on time), this goes for Front Desk as well.

2. History clearing up on a daily basis
3. There is meant to be vitals, allergies and prescription on the medical record’s interface
4. When inputting blood pressure the / should come automatically before the next set of
numbers (all units are to be provided by by the team)
5. The nurses needs to have access to all doctors medical record should be seen by the
nurses in term of view access.
Doctor’s Interface
1. On the medical record’s page, every line should have one line per patient with the total
number or visits. And not appearing twice.
2. Reduce the text on the record line so one can see about 10 patients before a doctor
scrolls
3. Include all the following below to improve the user experience of the doctor. When the
doctor clicks on these pages, it should pop up and when he is done can come back to
the medical records.
4. One should be able to search for a patient from the patient bar
5. Notification should be enabled for every patient that is added from the queue and for
every major milestone achieved.
6. Clinical note should be before diagnosis on the doctors dashboard
7. Patient queue should be ranked based on when they came in (timing) and based on
emergency (superceding the rank)
1. Add past records to the tab above after lab order.
2. Can all past appointments and medical records clickable.
3. We should be able to see all medical records (prescription, vitals etc) in one click and not
many clicks
4. We should be able to admit a patient on the medical record’s space.
5. On the medical record dashboard, there should be vitals, prescription, allergies and other
things on the same page
prescriptions
1. Duration (when prescribing) should have days in brackets.
2. Either we have list ot drug types (antimalarial etc) as a drop down, then all drugs that are
already in the inventory will show up in prescription. There should be a place that allows
prescription that are not in the facility
Inventory
3. In the inventory, we add another field which shows the dosage of the drug.
4. IN the inventory, for stock information, we need options for tablet count and cost or
card/total drug package per count. i f it is per package, we can quantify the number of
tablets still in the drug package and count.Then once the doctor prescribes it, it multiples
dosage x frequency x duration as number of tablets and cost. Once the pharmacist
dispenses it, it is automatically added into the invoice. Also HMO/self and corporate
pricing should be considered.
Other inventories
1. Nurses and Lab inventories who will have access to these respectively.
2. In nurses and Lab interfaces, same as the solution for pharmacy what was used for each
patient.
Lab order/investigations
1. There should be a place to add multiple tests same way we have add multiple orders like
in the pharmacy
2. List of all lab tests
Other updates
1. How's the allergy calculated on the dashboard
2. The name of the lab person Should be lab scientist not technician
3. Pharmacists should know patients on admission or not.
4. Failed to load patient on the pharmacist dashboard when he clicks on view patient
5. There should be option to skip vitals for some patients
6. The doctor should be able to see or admit patients
7. The excel sheet should mirror everything on the EMR
8. Other doctor should be able to see medical records of the patient that the previous
doctor attended to in order to continue treatment and once they edit, it shows they edited
it.
9. Lab scientist should finalise result before doctor can see the result and not the other way
round.
10. Enrollee number of the HMO patients should be included when the front desk is
registering the patient
11. A place to download all data on the super Momentum admin page.
12. A time tracker on every key stage in clinical flow. Time for registration to doctor, to lab
etc. to show efficiency of patient flow.
